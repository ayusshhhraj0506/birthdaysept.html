        <p>On your special day, my love, distance may separate us physically, but I am there and you are here with me always. Happy Birthday! I wish I could be there in person to celebrate and shower you with all the love and surprises you deserve. Though miles apart, our hearts remain connected, and this special occasion only reminds me of the beautiful moments we've shared and the countless more we'll create in the future. Until the day we can celebrate birthdays side by side, know that my thoughts and love are always with you, today and every day. Here's to another year of making our long-distance relationship stronger and more extraordinary. Happy Birthday, my darling! 🎂🎉❤️
